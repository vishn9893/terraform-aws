Install Terraform: To use Terraform, you'll need to install it on your local machine. You can download the appropriate version for your operating system from the Terraform website (https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

Create a Terraform configuration file: A Terraform configuration file describes the infrastructure you want to create. The file uses the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and has a .tf extension.

Initialize Terraform: Before you can start creating infrastructure, you need to initialize Terraform. This sets up the Terraform working directory and downloads any necessary plugins.

$ terraform init
Validate the Terraform configuration file: You can validate the syntax of your Terraform configuration file using the terraform validate command.

$ terraform validate
Plan the Terraform execution: You can use the terraform plan command to see what Terraform will do without actually making any changes. This is a good way to preview the changes and make sure they are what you expect.

$ terraform plan
Apply the Terraform plan: To actually create the infrastructure, use the terraform apply command. This command will prompt you for confirmation before making any changes.

$ terraform apply
